## NFT Illustration Metaspace
An innovative NFT platform that allows users to create and publish NFTs using a web-based SVG illustration tool, with royalty splitting and INK token integration.

- üí∞ Sales
  - Users can buy [INK](Contract\contracts\InkognitosInk.sol) tokens and publish [Nito](Contract\contracts\InkognitosNFT.sol) tokens
  - Users can buy a [StudioPass](Contract\contracts\INKStudioPass.sol) which allows them to use unlimited INK

- ‚úçÔ∏è Publishing
  - To publish, a user must provide a valid invoice to the NITO contract that asserts the ids and quantities of INK used
  - The publish transaction will deduct the INK from their wallet (or verify their publisher pass)
  - The server uses paper.js to count the quantity of of INK used, and generates a signed invoice of the colors and quantities

- üî® Decomposition
  - INK tokens that were used to publish NITOS are stored in the InkUsed contract
  - As an owner of a NITO token, you can "break" the artwork down into its INK, which transfers the INK used to your wallet, and burns the NITO token

- ü™ì Royalty Splitting
  - Royalties are split between the creator and the treasury
  - NITO creator receive royalties from the after-market sales of their NITOS for ever
